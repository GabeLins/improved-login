# Login System
An improved version of my very first code.

## About
Less than a year ago, I started my journey in the world of programming. I have started this journey by watching some Python tutorials made by a YouTube channel called Curso em Video, where I've learned the basics but didn't keep watching the videos because I've chosen to learn on my own.

My first project was a simple (and stupid) login system where the only way of adding a new user was by changing the source and attaching a new if-else block. 

This repository contains my very first code and its improved version, made using a lot of things I've learned in the past months.
